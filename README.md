# Tweeter-
Tweeter analysis sentiment project.

In this repo, there're two jupyter nooteboks. One notebook is the original, labeled as OG (Original Gangster), it were given to me by Pablo Celayes. The other one contains some lines added by me, with the purpose of collaborating with the sentymental Analysis of that dataset. The points i worked on are:
- A list with the columns, in order to get familiar with the features of the dataset.
- A line that shows the initial number of entries of the dataset
- A line that displays all the duplicate tweets.
- A line that drops all those duplicates and keeps the first original tweet.
- A line that gives us the total entries removed in the process of droping the duplicates.
- A line that fixes the size of the plot in the item "Top Hashtags por volumen de tuits"
- Finally, I added a plot disaplying the volume of hashtags per hour.
I hope this list is clear of following.
