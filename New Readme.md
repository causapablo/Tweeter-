## This is a practice.
* I want to drill on the concepts.
* I repeat the task until it gets automatic.
* I learnt this method in a book named "Learn Python: The Hard Way".

This file is a practice of adding a new file into the repository.
The idea is to make some changes to the repo, commit them, and then pushe them up to GitHub.
Thanks in advance.
